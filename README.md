# Titanic Dataset Analysis using Logistic Regression


Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Titanic dataset analysis repository. In this project, I've delved into the famous Titanic dataset to uncover insights using the logistic regression technique. Feel free to explore the code, findings, and visualizations that highlight the factors influencing survival rates.

## About the Dataset

The Titanic dataset is a historical dataset that contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not, their age, class, fare, and more. This dataset presents a unique opportunity to analyze historical data and gain insights into the factors that contributed to survival outcomes during the Titanic disaster.

## Approach

For this analysis, I chose to implement logistic regression, a statistical technique commonly used for binary classification tasks. The goal was to predict survival probabilities based on passenger features. Here's a quick rundown of my approach:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the dataset, handling missing values and converting categorical variables.

2. **Feature Selection:** Selected relevant features that might influence survival outcomes.

3. **Logistic Regression:** Implemented logistic regression using a suitable library to model the relationship between features and survival probability.

4. **Evaluation:** Evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics and visualizations, uncovering significant factors.

## Key Findings

Here are some of the key findings from my analysis:

- **Passenger Class Matters:** Higher class passengers had better survival chances, highlighting socio-economic influence.

- **Age and Gender:** Women and children had higher survival rates, reflecting the "women and children first" protocol.
